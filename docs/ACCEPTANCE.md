# Acceptance

The end goal is a working read/write filesystem in stock macOS through FSKit and
in Machlin through a kernel adapter, with the agreed Linux metadata contracts.
The rows below are requirements, not claims of implementation. A checkpoint does
not complete the project. Format support must expand with tested real images;
safe rejection of a feature is recorded separately from supporting it.

| Contract | Required evidence | Current state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Geometry, feature negotiation, metadata checksums | Real mke2fs images and malformed-input tests under sanitizers | Initial 1/4 KiB image profile passes; broader matrix pending |
| Inodes, directories, links, extents, sparse data | Independent contents and metadata comparison | Portable reader profile passes; mounted platform acceptance pending |
| Modern format variations | Explicit feature/size matrix including checksums, 64-bit fields, indexed directories and additional enabled features | Not accepted |
| Create/write/truncate, allocation, rename, unlink | Linux roundtrips, full disks, partial I/O and open-file lifetime | Not implemented |
| Journal and recovery | Interrupted transactions, ordering faults, device errors, Linux replay and e2fsck | Not implemented |
| Xattrs, permissions and ACLs | Preserve and mutate metadata across macOS/Linux roundtrips | Not implemented |
| Stock macOS FSKit | Actual mount, ordinary application I/O, concurrency, mmap and unmount on an Apple kernel | Not implemented |
| Kernel adapter | Actual loaded kext, vnode/UBC behavior, fault/truncate/writeback and resource balance | Not implemented |
| LXNU policy | CAP_FSETID and privilege removal, xattrs, mixed-ABI races, inherited descriptions and attachment restrictions | Not implemented |
| Compatibility and regression | Shared Linux/LXNU fixtures, native controls and identified stock/custom boots | Not run |
| Distribution | Reproducible standalone build, packaged FSKit extension, documented installation and supported versions | Not implemented |

Each accepted row must identify its test command and generated evidence location.
Raw identities, hashes and logs stay in ignored artifacts; source revisions stay
in Git. Generated images never enter source history. Unsupported advanced ext4
features remain visible requirements or explicit scope decisions; they may not be
silently reclassified to declare the project complete.

## Portable reader evidence

`tests/generate_fixtures.py` creates three 64 MiB images: 4 KiB blocks, 1 KiB
blocks, and an e2fsck-indexed copy. The explicit feature set includes extents,
64-bit descriptors, flex_bg and metadata_csum. Each generated image must pass
e2fsck; the generator rejects extra or missing feature flags.

`make test` runs the image reader and malformed-image suites. The reader verifies
exact bytes for ordinary, empty, short/long symlink and sparse files, hard-link
identity, nested and indexed directory enumeration, unaligned reads, EOF and
allocation/I/O failure cleanup during mount. The malformed-image suite checks
the CRC32C standard vector, geometry, incompatible flags, recovery state and
superblock/group/inode/directory checksum rejection. Current local reports live
under `artifacts/checks/`. Independently regenerated images under
`artifacts/fixtures-reproduced/` passed the same reader suite and e2fsck.

The freestanding compilation is not a loaded kernel driver. Its only non-core
undefined symbols are compiler stack-protector support, which XNU exports through
Libkern. The sanitizer build has a different frame layout and is tested separately.
